              <h3>Years of playing &amp; coaching</h3>
              <p>
                Ben has been playing chess since childhood and has spent years
                casually teaching friends, family, and local players. Over time,
                he realized that many people who could benefit most from the structure
                and joy of chess had the fewest opportunities to learn.

              <h3>Seeing the need up close</h3>
              <p>
                After spending time in spaces like the Community Kitchen, the YMCA,
                local libraries, and coffee shops, Ben noticed how many people were
                looking for connection, routine, and something meaningful to focus on.
                Chess became a natural bridge.

              <h3>A simple idea: teach for free</h3>
              <p>
                Instead of charging standard coaching rates, Ben began offering
                lessons free of charge for people experiencing homelessness, mental
                health challenges, disability, or financial hardship, and asking
                the broader community to support the work through donations.
